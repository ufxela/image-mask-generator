# Image Mask Generator

Image Mask Generator (IMG) is a tool for generating image masks, which are 
simply black and white images.

The motivation for image masks is that they can be displayed on projectors in 
order to highlight items on a wall.

Users should be able to take a photo from the perspective of their projector,
upload the photo to IMG, have a convenient UI to generate an image mask, and 
then project that image mask onto their wall in order to highlight different
objects on the wall with projector light.
